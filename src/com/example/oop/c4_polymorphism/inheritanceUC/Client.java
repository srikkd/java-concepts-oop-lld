        // because currently at CT, Student object is not even created and assigned to variable u
        // so, only way to check for compiler for u.setPsp() to be valid statement is by DT of u, which is User here
        // so, Compiler thinks that what all a User class object can access?

//        u.changePassword("Hello");
