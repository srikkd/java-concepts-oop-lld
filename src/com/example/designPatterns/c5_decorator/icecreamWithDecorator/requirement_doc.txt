Please create a class diagram and code to represent a Pizza with the following set of requirements.
Every pizza has a name and a description.
We need to get the cost and description of constituents of the pizza.
There are 4 base pizzas on which toppings can be added later, if needed by the customer.
These pizzas, along with their costs, are:
Farmhouse - Rs. 150
Margherita - Rs. 200
Pepperoni - Rs. 180
BBQChicken - Rs. 200

There are 4 types of toppings that are supported.
A customer may want to add any quantity of them (Eg: They may want to add Olives twice).
The toppings, along with their costs, are:
Olive - Rs. 20
Tomato - Rs. 30
Cheese - Rs. 80
Paneer - Rs. 60

Your class diagram, when implemented, should be able to successfully compile and run for following code:

Pizza p = new Paneer(new Cheese(new Tomato(new BBQChicken())));
System.out.printLn(p.getCost()); // should output 370
System.out.printLn(p.getDescription()); // should output BBChicken +            Tomato + Cheese + Paneer
